# Hey there, I'm X! ðŸ‘‹

As a versatile Software Developer, I bring experience in both front-end and back-end development, primarily using JavaScript and React along with its various frameworks like Redux, Express, and Typescript. My expertise extends to working with PostgreSQL and Knex as a JS query builder, demonstrating my ability to handle diverse technologies. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to explore and adapt to different technologies across various roles, continually expanding my skill set. Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to innovative solutions.

## ðŸ’­ About Me
I have over 3 years of experience as a developer and continually expand my technical skill set. My favorite thing about code is that there's always a more creative and efficient way to do the same thing.

Outside of code I like to play drums, photography, kickboxing, and cooking.
