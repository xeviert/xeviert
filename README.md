## 💭 About Me
My name is Xevier and I'm a full stack developer from Texas with a background in the financial services industry. My favorite thing about code is that there's always a more creative and efficient way to do the same thing.

Outside of code I like photography, workout, cooking, and to play drums.

## 🌱 Studying Agenda
Testing - I am adding more extensive testing to my projects.
JWT - Going to study JWT more to have a more solid understanding of all the moving parts.
JS fundamentals - Currently taking Javascript lessons on FreeCodeCamp in order to have the fundamentals down a lot better.
